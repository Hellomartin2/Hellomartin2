- A little about me I am 51 years old former Marine the worked personal security THAT got a little dicey so I switched to driving a semi for the 
  next 26 years worked at FedEx for the last 15 years of that competed in 4 state truck driving championships took 3rd once and 2nd twice and 1st t
  the last year I competed left truck driving after being put on Insulin for Diabetes, I moved from T.N. to Florida ans I bought a cnc machine and a laser but could not find a niche 
  that paid the bills so I learned to weld worked at IAG (International Armor Group ) Fabricating and welding Armored vehicles went to a shipyard 
  as a class A welder Fabricator ended up running their 14x80 ft CNC Plasma cutter trained my replacement and set up a training program put myself 
  through a collage course on 3D graphics programing ( Auto-cad ) graduated with a 4.0 now an Alumni of U.A.G. went to work at the shipyards production 
  control and Safety office but because of my Diabetes was deemed a risk when they changed insurance providers so I went to work as a Hass vertical 
  vertical mill programer and operator was quickly promoted to shift manager at B.C.P. until I had a heart attack in august of 2020 I have had a 
  total of 5 stints put in and am doing good but I was told I can not go back to the same type of work,   I have always been good with computers and 
  learned Aut-ocad quickly and have always liked figuring things out I will look at something and say OK how can I build my own or what can I build 
  out of this I looked at all the Careers I think I would like and Web Div and full stack looks right up my ally I DO KNOW at my age I am going to 
  have to be better than my younger cohorts but that is ok I love a challenge.   WOW that's a lot ...
